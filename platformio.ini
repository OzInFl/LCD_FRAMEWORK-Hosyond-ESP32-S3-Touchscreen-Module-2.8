platform = espressif32

; Pick a generic S3 board
board = esp32-s3-devkitm-1
; If this one doesn't exist in your PlatformIO, try:
; board = esp32-s3-devkitm-1

upload_speed = 921600

; USB CDC serial on native USB (matches what you were using in Arduino IDE)
build_flags =
  -D ARDUINO_USB_MODE=1
  -D ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=0
  -D BOARD_HAS_PSRAM

; IMPORTANT: use a 16MB partition table
; Option A (recommended): copy your vendor partitions.csv into project root and use it:
;board_build.partitions = partitions.csv

; If you don't have a vendor partitions.csv, create one (see below).
